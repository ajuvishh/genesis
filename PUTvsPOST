Techinically, Post is an abstract layer whereas PUT is more specific

POST creates new resources. 
PUT is idempotent and updates/replaces a resource if it already exists.

What I have seen? 
On update, both methods fetch the entity and replace the entity's instance variable with the members of request body. 
Even though I can find the difference in theory, I can not see the difference in real scenarios.
