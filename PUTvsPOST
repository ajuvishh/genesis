Techinically, Post is an abstract layer whereas PUT is more specific

POST creates new resources. 
PUT is idempotent and updates/replaces a resource if it already exists.

What I have seen? 
On update, both methods fetch the entity and replace the entity's instance variable with the members of request body. 
Even though I can find the difference in theory, I can not see the difference in real scenarios.

#### Update
We can even use Getmapping for updating. The update logic gets implemented in the service layer. 
As of now I think mappings indicate what kind of logic we are going to use. Not really sure if there's an impact.
