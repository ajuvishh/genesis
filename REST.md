1. Resource Identification through URIs

2. Uniform interface: Resources are manipulated using a fixed set of four create, read, update, delete operations

3. Self-descriptive messages: Resources are decoupled from their representation so that their content can be accessed in a variety of formats, such as HTML, XML, plain text, PDF, JPEG, JSON

4. Stateful interactions through hyperlinks: Every interaction with a resource is stateless; that is, request messages are self-contained.
